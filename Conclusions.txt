1. We can concluse from all the experiments that in case we are having expert designed features which included the efforts made by the domain experts , then simple machine learning models also perfrom very good and are able to give Ml models with good accuracy 

2. We can also conclude that in case the domain experts are not available , then in that case RNN designed with basic LSTM layers were able to perform good without any hyper parameter tuning.

3. Both the machine learning and deep learning model did not good in classifing standing and sitting class as data recieved by the sensors during both the activites was almost same.
